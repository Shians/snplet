\title{Plot inactive X chromosome heatmap for a donor}
\usage{
plot_inactive_x_heatmap(x, donor)

\S4method{plot_inactive_x_heatmap}{SNPData}(x, donor)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SNPData object containing X chromosome SNP data}

\item{donor}{Character string specifying which donor to visualize}
}
\value{
A ComplexHeatmap object showing the inactive X clustering pattern
}
\description{
Visualizes allelic imbalance patterns at informative heterozygous SNPs to
reveal X-inactivation structure. Cells are clustered based on their allelic
bias signatures, which should separate into two groups corresponding to the
two inactive X states.
}
\details{
This function creates a heatmap showing the sign of allelic expression at
heterozygous SNPs across cells from a single donor. The heatmap uses:
\itemize{
  \item Rows: Informative heterozygous SNPs on the X chromosome (one per gene)
  \item Columns: Individual cells/barcodes
  \item Values: Sign of allelic imbalance (+1 for REF bias, -1 for ALT bias, 0 for balanced)
  \item Clustering: Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance
}

The clustering should reveal two main groups of cells, each showing opposite
allelic bias patterns across SNPs. This bimodal pattern reflects which of the
two parental X chromosomes is inactive in each cell.

Only SNPs with at least 2 reads coverage in at least 1% of cells are included
to focus on informative loci.
