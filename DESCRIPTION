Description: Enables downstream analysis of allele-specific expression and clonal evolution in 
    single-cell RNA sequencing data using output from cellSNP-lite, Vireo, and cellranger VDJ.
    The package integrates SNP genotype calls, donor assignments, and clonotype annotations to
    assess allelic imbalance and analyze clonal relationships across individual cells. Core
    functionality includes statistical testing for differential allele usage and aggregation
    of allele counts across cells sharing clonotypes or donor identities.
