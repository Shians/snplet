# snplet

A work-in-progress R package for handling single-cell SNP data in terms of REF and ALT counts, where clonotype and donor ids are present.

## Overview

This package provides functionality for analyzing single-cell SNP data, particularly focusing on:
- Handling REF and ALT allele counts from SNP data
- Managing metadata containing clonotype and donor information
- Computing various allele-specific expression metrics
- Supporting operations on both cell-level and aggregated (donor/clonotype) data

## Status

This package is currently under development. The core functionality is implemented but the API may change as the package evolves.
